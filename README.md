# FlappyBird
A simple SDL-based flappy bird clone

To comile:
  Requirements:
    SDL 2.0.0 or newer
    SDL2 image v2.0.0 or newer
    Compile all of the code and open the project in the parent folder, else you'll get an error that it can't find images
    
    Makefile to speed up the make process in on the way

Version 0.1:
  Code is currently using different c files, as kind of class which I'm planing to change
  Currently only one bird color is supported, and only daytime background is used
  Bird animation also needs to be edited
  
Version 0.2:
  Added a PAUSE_STATE and connected it to game logic, have to add pause menu to it yet
  Fixed bird animation
